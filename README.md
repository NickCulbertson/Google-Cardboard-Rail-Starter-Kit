# Google-Cardboard-Rail-Starter-Kit
This demonstrates how to make a Google Cardboard Rail/Roller Coaster Starter Kit in Unity3D. Feel free to use it as you wish :). The project includes a demo scene, path following script, rail assets, and the Cardboard SDK. I'd recommend updating the Cardboard SDK if you plan on doing anything with the asset, but it should give you a pretty good idea of how to make a passive cart app. Enjoy!
